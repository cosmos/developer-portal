    - title: Is this portal for me?
      description: |
        This portal offers an overview of the Interchain Stack (the Cosmos SDK, Ignite, CosmJS, etc.), as well as examples and exercises to help developers get a quick start.
    - title: How should I go through the portal?
      description: |
        The portal content unfolds the Interchain universe, beginning with a big-picture perspective and getting into how to create your application-specific blockchain with the Cosmos SDK. The introductory chapters give you a solid overview of the Cosmos SDK, its concepts, and dApps built on the Interchain Stack, while the hands-on exercises put theory into practice – showcasing how to address application concerns when developing such as managing gas fees, working with Ignite CLI, running a node, and making a chain IBC-enabled. A look into all chapters is recommended, as a basic understanding helps when things get tricky. <br/>
        You can follow your own path or go through the content chronologically. To follow your own path, select the tags for the subjects you are interested in and all the chapters and sections relating to that subject will be displayed. <br/>
        Additionally, you can select a version of the portal if you want to explore the content in a specific Interchain Stack version. For more information on which stack version is used in the different versions of the portal, please <a href="/versions.html">go to the page on Platform Versions</a>. In general, we do recommend using the most current version.
    - title: What do I need to know?
      description: |
        For the conceptual, high-level sections, you should have a solid understanding of blockchain technology and be familiar with decentralized applications. The deep dives are specially designed for experienced developers.
    - title: How long will it take?
      description: |
        With the concept sections, you will gain a solid understanding of Cosmos and the Interchain Stack. This might be a matter of just a couple of hours. The time you spend on the other chapters and the hands-on exercise depends on you – there are endless possibilities to discover. <br/><br/>
        Welcome to the Interchain!

This repo contains the code and content for the [Developer Portal](https://developers.cosmos.network/) and the [Interchain Developer Academy](https://academy.cosmos.network/).

Note: The layout metadata at the top of the README.md file controls how the tutorial page is published. Write permissions are limited to preserve the structure and contents.

These tutorials guide you through actionable steps and walk-throughs to teach you how to use the Interchain Stack. The Interchain Stack is the world’s most popular framework for building application-specific blockchains, it consists of several products:

* **Cosmos SDK**, a modular framework to build blockchain applications
* **IBC**, the Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol that allows blockchains to communicate
* **Tendermint**, the algorithm that provides the consensus and networking layer for your blockchain application through CometBFT

The Developer Portal contains three types of content:

* **Concepts**, informational content explaining how the Interchain Stack functions
* **Individual Tutorials**, short tutorials to get you up to speed with individual components
* **Checkers Game**, a modular tutorial that covers the full stack and teaches you every element from set-up to launching in production with a front-end application attached.

Going through the entire content will teach you about:

* Blockchain technology and cryptography
* Developing with the Cosmos SDK & Ignite CLI
* The CometBFT consensus algorithm
* The Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol
* Building front- and backends with CosmJS
* Integrating wallets such as Keplr
* Relaying in the interchain network

The code and docs for each tutorial are based on a specific version of the software. Be sure to follow the tutorial instructions to download and use the right version.

Use the tutorials landing page as your entry point to articles on the [Interchain blog](https://blog.cosmos.network/), videos on [Interchain YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/CosmosProject/videos), and ways to get help and support.

This repo manages and publishes the developer platform. **If you would like to contribute**, please take a look at our [CONTRIBUTION GUIDELINES](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [/developer-portal/TECHNICAL-SETUP](TECHNICAL-SETUP.md) documents.

## Deployment
The main developer portal at [https://tutorials.cosmos.network](https://tutorials.cosmos.network) (and [https://developers.cosmos.network/](https://developers.cosmos.network/)) is deployed with GitHub Pages. The IDA deployment at [https://ida.interchain.io/](https://ida.interchain.io/) and both preview deployments are processes by Netlify.
