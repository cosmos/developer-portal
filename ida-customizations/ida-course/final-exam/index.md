Before exam period: 
The Final Exam will be released on **Thursday, January 4th, 2024**.

After exam period:

Congratulations on getting this far! You are now ready to take the exam, if you have not started it yet. You can work on your exam until **February 1st** and can submit your exam whenever you feel ready. Importantly, February 1st is a hard cut-off, and we are not granting extensions.

The exam is composed of two parts:

* One **coding project** that involves the Cosmos SDK, Ignite CLI, and CosmJS.
* One **IBC relayer operations** exercise.

## Coding project

An experienced developer can tackle the coding project in 4 hours or less. We have created a repository for you to upload your work on `git.academy.b9lab.com`. You can find your own repository [here](https://git.academy.b9lab.com/ida-p5-final-exam/student-projects). It was forked from [another repository](https://git.academy.b9lab.com/ida-p5-final-exam/exam-code) to which you have read-only access.

The detailed steps you need to follow are described in a dedicated `readme.md` file.

This server runs a Gitlab instance that we manage internally. It runs a CI/CD pipeline that grades your submission as soon as you push it to your repository. You can push as many times as you want and, we hope, see your score increase with every push (more details are in the `readme`).

Please do not modify the [`.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://git.academy.b9lab.com/ida-p5-final-exam/exam-code/-/blob/main/.gitlab-ci.yml) file, as doing so would invalidate your score.

The coding project counts for 90% of your overall exam score. This means that if the grading pipeline yields the line `FS_SCORE:100%`, then congratulations, you already have reached 90% for the overall exam.

Please do not disclose solutions or details of a solution of the exam on public forums so that it can stay relevant as long as possible.

## IBC operations

An experienced developer can tackle the IBC operations exercise in 2 hours or less.

This part of the exam counts for 10% of your overall exam score. Unlike the coding project, there are no partial scores. That means you either achieve the goal or you do not. Therefore, in terms of impact on your overall exam score, it either adds 0% or it adds 10%.

You should have received an email that provides two pieces of information that are **unique to you**:

1. The recipient address.
2. The origin denomination.

Head [here](https://git.academy.b9lab.com/ida-p5-final-exam/exam-ibc-operation/-/blob/main/exercise-description.md) for the complete exercise description. Take note of the parts where it mentions the identifiers that are unique to you.

We have a service that runs on a schedule and checks if you completed the expected transfer. After you have completed this part, give or take a few hours, you should receive an email confirming that our server successfully detected the transfer you made.

Sometimes, the testnet faucet hits its daily cap. Just to be on the safe side, you can ask for your testnet ATOMs ahead of time. See [here](https://git.academy.b9lab.com/ida-p5-final-exam/exam-ibc-operation/-/blob/main/exercise-description.md).

Also, if you do not have write access to the faucet channel, try first to type _Faucet_, _Access_ or _Testnet_ in  the [⁠💬┇general](https://discord.com/channels/669268347736686612/928239045291679754) channel. A bot will then give you the write permissions.

## Overall exam score

To calculate your overall exam score, we combine:

1. Your score from the coding project, with a weight of `0.9`.
2. Your score from the IBC operations, with a weight of `0.1`.

If your overall score is 80% or higher, then congratulations, you have passed.

## Email schedule

There are a number of emails that you have received, will receive, or could receive with regards to the exam:

1. The _exam is open_ email, which:
   1. Invites you to our Gitlab server.
   2. Mentions the two pieces of information that are unique to you, for the IBC operations part.
2. An email that congratulates you on passing the IBC operations part of the exam, as and when our server detects your correct transfer.
3. A deadline reminder email one week before the deadline.
4. A _pass_ or _fail_ email, that you will receive after the deadline.

Good luck!
